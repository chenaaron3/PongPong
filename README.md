**Unity Game Puzzle Solver**

Span of Project: 4/27/18 - 11/19/18

**How To Play**
1. Download the .rar file.
2. Run the .exe file.

**Game Background**
Place pieces to direct a fireball towards slimes and away from water bombs. There are 3 pieces: a start piece, a turn piece, and an end piece. Using limited tiles, the player must devise a way to efficiently use the space and pieces provided. In the end, there is a generator that randomly generates a guaranteed solvable problem with a given solution. 

**Script Accomplishments**
Getting the basic mechancis of this game was simple. However, taking on the task of creating and solving a puzzle problem with my own rules and constrictions was tough. 

- pong pong theory (using dots, major and minor)
- using recursive algorithm to search from dot to dot
- using recursive algorithm to get combo of dots to dots
